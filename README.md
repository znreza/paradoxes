# Q-learning algorithm

Q-learning is a widely-used Reinforcement Learning algorithm used for optimal policy learning by AI agents. I have implemented the Q-learning algorithm from scratch for optimal path finding in small grids containing random obstacles. This code can be easily extended to work on any large size of grid, with any number of obstacles.
